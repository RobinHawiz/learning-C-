# .NET/C# learning repo
This repository represents the initiative I take on my own to learn .NET/C#. The folders inside this repo show the concepts that i've learned/still learning so far. You will also find different sections within this README file that showcase my skills in .NET/C#.

## List of things to learn
This section show the things I've learned or will work on in the future. Keep in mind that this is not a list of all things that exist in .NET/C#, but a list of things I've found to be important and want to focus on. This list is ever-changing.

Meaning of different emojis: 

âœ… = I've worked with it and I'm proficient with it.

ðŸŸ¨ = I've worked with it but still need to learn more about it.

ðŸŸ¥ = I haven't worked with it but will in the future.

## Notes to self:
This section contains things that I should keep in mind regarding the development of .NET applications.

- Test your queries before adding them to your data access code.

- Seperate your user interface from your data access.
